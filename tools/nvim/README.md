# nvim

My favorite text and code editor.

## Install

Run the following command to have it automatically install everything for Linux:

```bash
./install-on-linux.sh
```

Or you can do it manually. Install `nvim` using your package manager of choice.
Then, copy all files from `settings/*` over to `~/.config/nvim/`.
Finally, open `nvim` and execute the command `:PackerSync`.
